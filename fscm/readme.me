# File Size Change Monitor

This WordPress plugin monitors file size changes on your website and notifies the administrator via email when changes are detected.  It scans your entire website's file system (excluding specified folders) and compares the current file sizes to the sizes from the last scan.

## Features

*   **Automated Scanning:** Scans your website's files on a scheduled interval (daily or hourly).
*   **Email Notifications:** Sends an email to the administrator with a list of files that have changed in size, including the old and new sizes.
*   **Customizable Scan Interval:** Allows you to choose between daily and hourly scans.
*   **Folder Exceptions:**  Allows you to exclude specific folders from the scan (e.g., cache directories, backup folders).
*   **Easy Setup:** Simple installation and configuration through the WordPress admin settings.

## Installation

1.  Download the plugin as a zip file.
2.  In your WordPress admin, go to Plugins > Add New and upload the zip file.
3.  Activate the plugin.

## Usage

1.  After activating the plugin, go to Settings > File Size Monitor.
2.  Configure the following settings:
    *   **Email Address:** Enter the email address where you want to receive notifications.
    *   **Scan Interval:** Choose the frequency of the scans (daily or hourly).
    *   **Folder Exceptions:** Enter a comma-separated list of folders to exclude from the scan.  Paths should be relative to your WordPress root directory (e.g., `wp-content/uploads/cache`, `another/folder`).
3.  Click "Save Changes."

The plugin will now run automatically according to the selected interval.
